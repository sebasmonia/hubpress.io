There are plenty of posts about configuring alternative diff/merge tools to use with Team Foundation Server. The ones I liked the most are http://blog.iannelson.systems/tfs-alternative-diff-merge-tools/ by Ian Nelson, who shows with nice screenshots HOW to change the TFS tools, and also includes a link to another post that explain exactly the order in which the parameters are passed.

Putting together both I arrived at my current configuration to launch ediff when running compares from TFS:
