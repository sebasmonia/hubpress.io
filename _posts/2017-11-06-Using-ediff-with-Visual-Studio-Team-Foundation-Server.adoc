= Using ediff with Visual Studio/Team Foundation Server

There are plenty of posts about configuring alternative diff/merge tools to use with Team Foundation Server. The one I liked the most is http://blog.iannelson.systems/tfs-alternative-diff-merge-tools/ by Ian Nelson, who shows with nice screenshots HOW to change the TFS tools, and also includes a link to another post that explains the order in which the parameters are passed.

Putting together both posts I arrived at my current configuration to launch ediff when running compares from TFS:

The little helper ediff.bat lives in my command line "binaries" folder (so it's part of PATH) and it's contents are pretty straigthforward:

----
@echo off
set command=%1
set original=%2
set original=%original:\=\\%
set original=%original:"=\"%
set modified=%3
set modified=%modified:\=\\%
set modified=%modified:"=\"%

:compare
c:\HomeFolder\emacs\bin\emacsclientw -c -n -e "(ediff-files %original% %modified%)"
goto exit

:merge
set ancestor=%4
set ancestor=%ancestor:\=\\%
set ancestor=%ancestor:"=\"%
set output=%5
set output=%output:\=\\%
set output=%output:"=\"%
c:\HomeFolder\emacs\bin\emacsclientw -c -n -e "(ediff-merge-with-ancestor %original% %modified% %ancestor% nil %output%)"
goto exit

:exit
----

Dissecting this, at first we have some string replace to escape the paths (\ becomes \\). As per the MSDN blog article, these are already quoted. Then through the -e parameter we can start ediff, for justa compare or merging. The list of entry points are in the Emacs manual.
You can also find a copy of the batch file in my Emacs configuration repository, but the above is all there is to is.

I figure an alternative would be an elisp funcion that you invoke and does the conversion of the strings to paths and then starts ediff. But since I already had some experience with batch files replaces, I just went with this approach.

Bonus! there are two configuration options that make this smoother:

* ediff-highlight-all-diffs: set to t to highlight the char-to-char differences instead of just blocks.
* ediff-keep-variants: if you set this to nil, when quitting the ediff session you will be prompted to closed the buffers you just compared.
