<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three small tips for your <code>init.el</code> file.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_set_proxy">Set proxy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to use MELPA, ELPA, etc. behind your corporate proxy, you need to configure it in the init file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(setq url-proxy-services
   '(("no_proxy" . "^\\(localhost\\|10.*\\)")
     ("http" . "10.10.10.10:8080")
     ("https" . "10.10.10.10:8080")))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good way to get your proxy (unless the admins are cool and just share it) is to get the .dat file, as explained here: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/346372/how-do-i-know-what-proxy-server-im-using" class="bare">https://superuser.com/questions/346372/how-do-i-know-what-proxy-server-im-using</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would also recommended to set the proxy in HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_utf_8">UTF-8</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a native Spanish speaker, sometimes I drop accented characters, like the á in Sebastián</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem seemed to be that the defauls in Emacs and in Windows are different&#8230;&#8203;or something like that. Whatever the case, this single line solved all my encoding problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_dired_launch">Dired-launch</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I still deal daily with Excel, Word, Outlook, etc. I did replace 99% of  Windows Explorer with Dired, and one of the small tools that made a difference for me was dired-launch: <a href="https://github.com/thomp/dired-launch" class="bare">https://github.com/thomp/dired-launch</a>
Basically what dired-launch does is equivalent to <code>start "" file-path</code> in the command prompt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have it bound to J (shift + j) and C-c j, although I think J is the default binding, and for some reason I added an extra one that I&#8217;m not using?.
Anyway, for Windows there isn&#8217;t any other configuration required:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp">(dired-launch-enable)
(global-set-key (kbd "\C-cj") 'dired-jump)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can launch any type of file from the Dired buffer directly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of blogging quite a few times, as a lot of programmers do. So, why this time I&#8217;m really doing it? What gave me the push to get started?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not like I didn&#8217;t have things to say, I always do, it&#8217;s just that now I feel I can say things that could be useful to others. After working for 10+ years purely in .NET and other related technologies, I&#8217;ve moved to more open things (Python, Linux).
But unlike many colleagues who made the jump from MS shops to Python/Ruby/etc. shops, I have NOT moved :) I still have my regular job with Exchange and corporate proxies and TFS-is-my-source-control-sad-smiley.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another reason I think I can contribute to the conversation is that I don&#8217;t hate any of the tools that I&#8217;m leaving behind. A few days ago, I asked a question in r/emacs and someone gave me their condolences for using Visual Studio for so long. And I had to explain that even though I prefer other tools now, I can still appreciate how great of an IDE VS is. Heck if I&#8217;m in a hurry and I haven&#8217;t quite cracked how to get Emacs to play nicely with something I need, I won&#8217;t hesitate to start VS (and wait for a few minutes ;) at least for VS 2013/2015) to finish the job at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So in essence, I feel my position is relatively unique/uncommon. I hope I can help others navigate The Neutral Zone, by documenting some of the things I do, how I workaround the differences between Linux and Windows, what worked for me and what didn&#8217;t.
And hopefully if someone ever reads this I can start getting their tips and together we can make our journey easier!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll let the readers decide which group is the Federation and which group is the Romulans in my analogy. I&#8217;m not taking sides :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PS: Since the blog is already up I might also share some more opinionated things, eventually. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
